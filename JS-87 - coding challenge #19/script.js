// ! Coding challenge #19

// ? Let's go back to Julia and Kate's study about dogs. This time, they want to convert
// ? dog ages to human ages and calculate the average age of the dogs in their study.
// ? Your tasks:
// ? Create a function 'calcAverageHumanAge', which accepts an arrays of dog's
// ? ages ('ages'), and does the following things in order:

// * 1. Calculate the dog age in human years using the following formula: if the dog is
// * <= 2 years old, humanAge = 2 * dogAge. If the dog is > 2 years old,
// * humanAge = 16 + dogAge * 4

// * 2. Exclude all dogs that are less than 18 human years old (which is the same as
// * keeping dogs that are at least 18 years old)

// * 3. Calculate the average human age of all adult dogs (you should already know
// * from other challenges how we calculate averages ðŸ˜‰)

// * 4. Run the function for both test datasets

// * Test data:
// * Â§ Data 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]
// * Â§ Data 2: [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]

// GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

const agesArray = [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3];
const agesArray2 = [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3];

const calcAverageHumanAge = (ages) => {
  const humanAges = ages.map((age) => {
    return age <= 2 ? 2 * age : 16 + age * 4;
  });

  const adultDogs = humanAges.filter((age) => {
    return age >= 18;
  });

  const averageDogAge = adultDogs.reduce((acc, age, i, arr) => {
    return acc + age / arr.length;
  }, 0);

  console.log(humanAges);
  console.log(adultDogs);
  console.log(averageDogAge);
};

calcAverageHumanAge(agesArray);
